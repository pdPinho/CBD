No redis eu não utilizei o TTL do Redis pois naquela altura ainda não tinha estudado os slides, por isso a maneira como eu resolvi não foi muito eficaz.

The difference between MongoDB and Redis is that one is a key-value database and the other is a document based database


Implementation:
    MongoDB:
        - Created a database for this exercise, where we would create and insert documents
        - For the first exercise I decided to keep all the history and simply gather all the values above a certain timestamp.
        - For the second exercise I decided to use a TTL, where I created an index which would delete a document after X time.

    Redis:
        - Each entry is a key (so we could associate something such as [user: {product_dictionary}])
        - I used the same implementation for both with my own timestamp and "TTL".
        - However we could've used Redis' "expire" option


Performance:
    Redis will always provide us with O(1) lookup time - as long as things fit in our memory
    MongoDB however will vary between O(n) and O(log n) - depending if you have an index or not


Advantages / Disadvantages:
    Since redis is an in-memory storage, the moment you turn it off, you lose it all (unless you have snapshots)
    Mongo on the other hand has persistent data since it is written on the disk
    Redis has a limit in terms of how much data you can have (RAM), whilst Mongo's limitation is the size of your disk (example: 16GB vs 256GB)
    If you want to look up something in Redis, then you must know the key to look up - and changing a bucket means rewriting it entirely
    (same happens if you want to "look up" a specific value within a bucket. You have to read the entire bucket nonetheless)
    In mongo you can look for specific documents based on their values and can change their values without having to alter everything
